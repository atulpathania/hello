h1 "humans"Why Use FTP?
FTP stands for File Transfer Program/Protocol. An FTP client program is used to move files from one
computer to another, generally from your computer (the client) to a server. In order to update a website, the
general process is to transfer a file from the server (download), make changes to it, and transfer the changed file
back to the server (upload).
